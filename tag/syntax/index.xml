      <title>Ambiguity in negative dependencies</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many languages exhibit Negative Concord, that is when two negative items are interpreted as a single negation. For example, if a man has robbed a bank and says &lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t do nothing&lt;/em&gt;, we understand this as &lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything&lt;/em&gt; even though he used two negative words&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. By contrast, if a mother comes home from work and finds her child sitting in front of the television, she might accuse them of having done nothing all day, to which they might reply &lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t do nothing&lt;/em&gt;. The child, however means exactly the opposite of what the bank robber meant &amp;ndash; that they &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. French speakers have been shown to easily access both of these readings (Déprez et al. 2015), so we&amp;rsquo;ve undertaken a series of experiments to see how context (Déprez &amp;amp; Yeaton 2018), and prosody (Yeaton et al. forthcoming) might be employed to convey meaning. We also want to examine how good listeners are at leveraging these prosodic signals to access the meaning that the speaker intended (Loder et al. forthcoming).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rapid calculation of sentence structure in MEG</title>
      <link>https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/project/sse-meg/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence shows that people can discriminate a well-formed 4-word sentence from the same words arranged in an illegal order within 400 ms. This observation raises the question of how the syntactic structure for such word sequences could be constructed so rapidly. To elucidate the neural underpinnings of this process, we conducted a magnetoencephalography (MEG) study where participants were presented with either short well-formed sentences (+syntax), or the same words in a syntactically illicit order (-syntax). In both conditions, all words were presented simultaneously. Using an ROI-based source-level analysis, we found significantly more activation in the +syntax condition relative to the -syntax condition in parts of the left temporal lobe, as well as in the left IFG. These differences began at relatively early latencies (350ms post stimulus onset), in line with previous ERP results, and provide a glimpse of where syntax is first processed in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
