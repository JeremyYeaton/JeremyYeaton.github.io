      <title>Statistical learning in noise</title>
      <link>https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/project/sequence-learning/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a series of experiments using a motor sequence learning task, we are examining the effect of different types of noise on the baboons&#39; ability to extract a regularity (e.g.: AB) from a sequence. For example, if the baboon saw the pair AB 100 times, but each time it was in a different position in the sequence (e.g.: XABX, XXAB, ABXX, etc.), will that impede their ability to learn the relationship between A and B relative to if they only saw ABCD every trial?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a parallel project, we are constructing a computational model of this learning process to better understand how the process takes place in baboons, and how that differs from in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Co-registered natural story reading</title>
      <link>https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/project/natural-reading/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most studies of reading use experiments that employ contrived sentences designed to see how people react to bizarre input and/or use the Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) paradigm which presents one word at a time at the same location. While these can be informative, neither addresses how people &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; read under normal circumstances. The main goal of this project is to produce a co-registered eye-tracking and EEG dataset of people reading a real text (in this case, several chapters of a novel), under naturalistic conditions. While this can help answer some of our own research questions, it can also serve as a resource to others who want to test out their own predictions about language processing in a natural setting without having to design an experiment and collect their own data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sentence Superiority in MEG</title>
      <link>https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/project/sse-meg/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence shows that people can discriminate a well-formed 4-word sentence from the same words arranged in an illegal order within 400 ms. This observation raises the question of how the syntactic structure for such word sequences could be constructed so rapidly. To elucidate the neural underpinnings of this process, we conducted a magnetoencephalography (MEG) study where participants were presented with either short well-formed sentences (+syntax), or the same words in a syntactically illicit order (-syntax). In both conditions, all words were presented simultaneously. Using an ROI-based source-level analysis, we found significantly more activation in the +syntax condition relative to the -syntax condition in parts of the left temporal lobe, as well as in the left IFG. These differences began at relatively early latencies (350ms post stimulus onset), in line with previous ERP results, and provide a glimpse of where syntax is first processed in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experiment is part of a larger ERC Advanced Grant looking at parallel orthographic and sentence processing during reading.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ambiguity in negative dependencies</title>
      <link>https://jeremyyeaton.github.io/project/negation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many languages exhibit Negative Concord, that is when two negative items are interpreted as a single negation. For example, if a man has robbed a bank and says &lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t do nothing&lt;/em&gt;, we understand this as &lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything&lt;/em&gt; even though he used two negative words&amp;ndash;&lt;em&gt;didn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;. By contrast, if a mother comes home from work and finds her child sitting in front of the television, she might accuse them of having done nothing all day, to which they might reply &lt;em&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t do nothing&lt;/em&gt;. The child, however means exactly the opposite of what the bank robber meant &amp;ndash; that they &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. French speakers have been shown to easily access both of these readings (Déprez et al. 2015), so we&amp;rsquo;ve undertaken a series of experiments to see how context (Déprez &amp;amp; Yeaton 2018), and prosody (Yeaton &amp;amp; Déprez forthcoming) might be employed to convey meaning. We also want to examine how good listeners are at leveraging these prosodic signals to access the meaning that the speaker intended (Loder et al. forthcoming).&lt;/p&gt;
